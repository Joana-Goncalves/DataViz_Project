# DataViz_Project

This Tableau project was created for the "Data Visualization" course from the NOVA IMS Master's in Data Science. Link for the project in Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aidar.zaripov/viz/Evolutionofnaturaldisastersbetween1990and2019/Finaldashboard

The dashboard is based on the data from the United Nations Statistics Division about four types (climatological, geologycal, hydrological and meteorological) of disasters from a separate table each. Tables themselves include information about the number of occurrences of specific disasters in defined periods, the amount of people affected and the number of deaths due to the specific disaster occurrence. This information can be found on the csv files.

The data schema appears as three tables connected to the one main table “Climatological disasters” by the “CountryID” column. Also, there is one separate additional table “Natural disasters unpivot” another data source which is based on the same information about all 4 types of disasters but is used for more comfortable comparison and trend detection.

Featuring story-based navigation with distinct pages for each disaster type, users can explore specific incidents, filter data, and access informative tooltips for a tailored experience, to customise their viewing experience and gain deeper insights into disaster data.

On each story page a user can find a field divided into a trend graph and a map for the convenience of searching the area of an occurrence.
