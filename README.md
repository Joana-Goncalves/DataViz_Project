# Evolution of Natural Disasters between 1990 and 2019

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a comprehensive data visualization project developed for the "Data Visualization" course within the NOVA IMS Master's in Data Science program. The project focuses on analyzing the evolution of natural disasters between 1990 and 2019, leveraging data from the United Nations Statistics Division (EM-DAT database; it compiles data from various sources, with priority given to UN agencies, governments and Red Cross societies).<br>
The visualization project is accessible via Tableau Public at the following link: [Evolution of Natural Disasters between 1990 and 2019](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aidar.zaripov/viz/Evolutionofnaturaldisastersbetween1990and2019/Finaldashboard).

## Dashboard Features
### Data Sources and Schema
The csv files used for this project can be found on the [Datasets folder](https://github.com/Joana-Goncalves/DataViz_Project/tree/main/Datasets) from this repository.<br>
The project utilizes data sourced from four distinct tables, each dedicated to a specific type of disaster: climatological, geological, hydrological, and meteorological. These tables encapsulate detailed information such as the frequency of occurrences, the impact on affected populations, and the number of fatalities attributed to each disaster type. Additionally, a supplementary table, "Natural disasters unpivot," provides consolidated data for comparative analysis and trend identification.<br>
The data schema appears as three tables connected to the one main table “Climatological disasters” by the “CountryID” column.

### Interactive Visualization
Featuring story-based navigation with distinct pages for each disaster type, users can explore specific incidents, filter data (by continents, countries of type of information), and access informative tooltips for a tailored experience, to customise their viewing experience and gain deeper insights into disaster data.<br>
On each story page a user can find a field divided into a trend graph and a map for the convenience of searching the area of an occurrence.<br>
